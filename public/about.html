<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sebatian Campos and I graduated from Florida Gulf Coast University with a Bachlors Degree in SoftWare Engineering. During my
  time at the university I learned the programming languages C#, C++, Python, Java, and Kotlin each year in the program. One of the most important
  topics that I learned at the university level will be the agile model because during my senior year I worked with a company CallMiner which used the model.

<p>
  My time at CallMiner I learn how the agile methodology is used in a professional setting as a group with a couple other people. We learned about Scrum and each week
  the group I was in had weekly stand-up meetings and a one hour planning. This is also very important for my career because in school I was just taught what is without
  knowing how to use it in the real life setting. One of my teammates work in the frontend and the other two including myself worked in the backend. I job was to connect
  Prometheus to the restful API.
